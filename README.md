# Loan Processing Automation System

An AI-powered loan processing system that automates document verification and application workflows using state machines.


## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Core Architecture
1. **Document Upload**: Users submit paystubs, W2s, and bank statements
2. **AI Verification**:
   - LLM checks document consistency with application data
   - Computer vision validates document authenticity
3. **State Machine**:
   - Moves application through verification stages
   - Triggers automated actions (credit checks, risk analysis)
4. **Approval**: Final decision with audit trail

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- OpenAI API key
